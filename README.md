## All Adventure World Records !

SQL code for storing Hill Climb Racing Adventure World Records into a database.

Features a file called main.sql containing all 4 tables for players, adventure maps, vehicles and Hill Climb Racing 2 Adventure World Records. 

## Not just a list of World Records !

The file also comes with queries to select specific information about World Records, like getting a specific WR, calculating the average or total distance of every vehicle, ranking the best players / countries ordered by how many World Records they have, ranking all vehicles by their longest distance, and so much more.

The inserted data is constantly updated to have all World Records up to date.

## How to use this ??

### Go to main.sql

This is where all the code is stored. Copy the code in main.sql entirely.

### Find something that runs SQL

Then, search for a SQL compiler online (there are many cool ones online,  like this : https://www.programiz.com/sql/online-compiler/ ) or any software that runs SQL.

Paste the entire code on the SQL console.

### Use the queries

All the queries are in comments. To use one, simply remove the /* */ on each end.

### Have fun !
